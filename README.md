Hey SQL enthusiasts!,

Here, I am sharing the solutions from the LeetCode Study Plan SQL 50! These exercises offer a fantastic opportunity to hone your SQL skills from basic to intermediate level.

Let's break down some of the important functions, commands and keywords used in these solutions:

**Select Statements**
- 𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗖𝗧: The fundamental keyword in SQL, used to retrieve data from a database.
- 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘: Used to filter rows based on a specified condition.
- 𝗙𝗥𝗢𝗠: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
- 𝗔𝗡𝗗: A logical operator used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause, where all conditions must be true for the row to be selected.
- 𝗢𝗥: Another logical operator used to combine multiple conditions in a - WHERE clause, where at least one condition must be true for the row to be selected.
- 𝗢𝗥𝗗𝗘𝗥 𝗕𝗬: Sorts the result set based on specified columns in ascending or descending order.
- 𝗡𝗢𝗧 𝗘𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗟 (<>): Compares values to determine if they are not equal, offering flexibility in data comparisons.
- 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗨𝗟𝗟: An operator used to check if a value is NULL.

**Basic Joins**
- 𝗚𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗣 𝗕𝗬: Used to arrange identical data into groups, often combined with aggregate functions to produce summary results.
- 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
- 𝗜𝗡𝗡𝗘𝗥 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. Unmatched records from the right table will be NULL.
- 𝗖𝗥𝗢𝗦𝗦 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡: Produces the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning it returns all possible combinations of rows from the tables.
- 𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘𝗗𝗜𝗙𝗙: Calculates the difference between two dates, often used to measure time intervals.
- 𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗗: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
- 𝗔𝗩𝗚: Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
- 𝗛𝗔𝗩𝗜𝗡𝗚: Similar to WHERE, but used with aggregate functions to filter groups of rows.
- 𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗧: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.

**Basic Aggregate Functions**
- 𝗗𝗘𝗦𝗖: Sorts the result set in descending order.
- 𝗔𝗦𝗖: Sorts the result set in ascending order (It is the default value for the ORDER BY clause).
- 𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗗(): Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
- 𝗦𝗨𝗠(): Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
- 𝗠𝗜𝗡(): Retrieves the minimum value from a specified column.
- 𝗜𝗙(): Returns a value if a condition is TRUE, and another value if the condition is FALSE.
- 𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗧: Selects unique values from a column.
- 𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘_𝗔𝗗𝗗(): Adds a specified time interval to a date.

**Sorting and Grouping**
- 𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘_𝗦𝗨𝗕(): Subtracts a specified time interval to a date.
- 𝗠𝗔𝗫(): Retrieves the maximum value from a specified column.

**Advanced Select and Joins**
- 𝗨𝗡𝗜𝗢𝗡: Combines the result set of two or more SELECT statements.
- 𝗠𝗔𝗫: Returns the largest value.
- 𝗟𝗜𝗠𝗜𝗧: Specifies the number of records to return.
- 𝗖𝗧𝗘 (𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀): Result set of a query which exists temporarily and for use only within the context of a larger query.

These commands and keywords form the backbone of SQL queries, allowing us to manipulate and extract data efficiently.

Thank You!
