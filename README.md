Hey Everybody,

Here, I am sharing the solutions from the LeetCode Study Plan SQL 50! These exercises offer a fantastic opportunity to hone your SQL skills from basic to intermediate level.

Let's break down some of the important functions, commands and keywords used in these solutions:

- 𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗖𝗧: The fundamental keyword in SQL, used to retrieve data from a database.
- 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘: Used to filter rows based on a specified condition.
- 𝗙𝗥𝗢𝗠: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
- 𝗔𝗡𝗗: A logical operator used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause, where all conditions must be true for the row to be selected.
- 𝗢𝗥: Another logical operator used to combine multiple conditions in a - WHERE clause, where at least one condition must be true for the row to be selected.
- 𝗢𝗥𝗗𝗘𝗥 𝗕𝗬: Sorts the result set based on specified columns in ascending or descending order.
- 𝗡𝗢𝗧 𝗘𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗟 (<>): Compares values to determine if they are not equal, offering flexibility in data comparisons.
- 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗨𝗟𝗟: An operator used to check if a value is NULL.

These commands and keywords form the backbone of SQL queries, allowing us to manipulate and extract data efficiently.

Thank You!
